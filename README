 Chat System project for a Software Engineering class. Work was done
 in a team of 8 people using pair programming.

 Some of the technical constraints:
   -- use Spring to structure the server
   -- use ActiveMQ for communication between client and the server

Basic Requirements list :
1. Client connects to a specified server 
2. User signs on to the server the client is connected to 
3. User signs off from the server the client is connected to 
4. User sends a message to all currently signed-on users (Broadcast) 
5. Client quits. The Client application is terminated. 
6. Sending text to a specific subset of signed on users (instead of a 
   broadcast message.) 
7. Listing all users signed on to your server. 
8. User joins chat room and can send text messages to the chat room, which 
   causes all other users joined to the chat room to receive the message. 
9. User leaves chat room, which removes user from list of users receiving 
   messages for the chat  room. 
10. User lists all chat rooms that exist. 
11. User joined to a chat room lists all users also joined to the chat room. 
12. Provide both a textual interface and a graphical interface for your client.
